	            Customizing Natures
===------------------------------------------------------------------------------===
As of version 0.5 "Eagle's Launch", Anathema takes an user editable approach to natures. 
The program comes complete with all natures from the Exalted core rulebook, 
but copyright reasons permit the inclusion of the conditions from the distribution
archives. You are highly encouraged to replace the stub descriptions we provide by
more useful ones!

A nature in Anathema is represented by three parts: An unique ID for identification purposes,
the nature's name as it appears in the program and on character sheets and an optional 
willpower recovery condition. For the core natures already included, ID and Name are both 
set to the nature's name as given in the core rulebook, while the condition only states 
the page to look for a complete description.

The first step in changing existing natures as well as creating new ones is to create a 
new file "natures.xml" in the subdirectory "data", then editing the content of this file.
The nature file must begin with a root element "<naturelist>" and then specify any number of
"nature" entries, before ending with a final "</naturelist>".
Each "<nature>" element has it's id and name stored in attributes, so a very simple file could look
like:
//Example 1:
<naturelist>
	<nature id="CustomAnathemaNature" name="MyNature">
	</nature>
</naturelist>

This file is read during the Anathema launch process and it's contents are added to the
nature list. Our newly created nature would show as "MyNature" in the character concept screen.
To create a nature with a willpower recovery condition, the nature element is extended with a 
subelement "<willpower>", with a "text" attribute giving the conditions text:
//Example 2:
<naturelist>
	<nature id="CustomAnathemaNature" name="MyNature">
		<willpower text="whenever a new nature is created.">
		</willpower>
	</nature>
</naturelist>

NOTE: "Gain Willpower" is always included in front of the text, so you only enter the conditional
phrase ("when...", "any time...").

If the ID of an user specified nature is identical to one of the pre-defined natures (note correct
capitalization), the user specified one takes precedence and the predefined nature is dropped from 
the list.
This includes the willpower recovery condition, so if your nature.xml had an entry
//Example 3:
<naturelist>
	<nature id="Rebel" name="Rebellious Nature">
	</nature>
</naturelist>

the Rebel nature would not even show the page reference for the recovery condition.

On the other hand, if your new entry included the correct recovery text, it would from now on
be shown in Anathema.
